#  📚 Face Up

Hi,
I'm Yoann, I'm currently deepening my knowledge in web development. I'm specialized in React frontend development.
I had fun coding all these projects!
Feel free to ask me questions and don't hesitate to look at my other projects ;)
Have fun coding!

## ✍️ Description 

FaceUp is a mobile application that allows taking photos and storing them in an image gallery. The goal of this challenge is to implement various features of the app using React Native, Redux, and backend integration.

**Part 1: App Structure and Navigation**

The first part of the challenge is to create the structure of the application based on the mockups provided, set up the navigation, and create the different screens and their styles.

**Part 2: Image Upload and Persistence**

In the second part of the challenge, you will modify the SnapScreen component to send the photo taken to the backend and save the resulting Cloudinary URL in the Redux store for display in the gallery. You will also make the user's information (email and photos) persistent using the redux-persist module to retrieve their gallery and avoid having to enter their email every time the application is reloaded.

**Part 3: Cloudinary Image Hosting**

In the final part of the challenge, you will create a POST /upload route in the backend that receives a file and hosts it on Cloudinary. You will modify the SnapScreen component to send the photo taken to this route and save the resulting Cloudinary URL in the Redux store for display in the gallery.

To use Cloudinary, you will need to sign up for a free account and obtain an API key and secret. You can find more information on the Cloudinary website: **[https://cloudinary.com/](https://cloudinary.com/)**

This challenge is suitable for developers who want to improve their skills with React Native, Redux, backend integration, and media storage. Feel free to fork this project and start coding!
